  Error checking was not a requirement for Assignment_1, however it is always good to practice it.
  Overall, you got the problems done with few lines of code while meeting the requirements.

SphereArea.py
  It would be better if the function returned the area.
  There is no error checking.
  Other than that, the function is fine.

SphereArea2.py
  While error checking was attempted, do not do:
    if float(var) == float
  This causes the code to not work even when inputting a number.
  It is better to use a try except to attempt the conversion and respond if an error occurs

SphereVolume.py
  You forgot to cube the radius.
  Also the function does not work. It should be:
    (4*(math.pi)*float(radius)**3)/3

tipcalc.py
  There is no error checking done in this function.
  If I enter 'f', the code will crash.
  Also, in your function:
    float(price) + float(price) * 0.09
  It would be a good idea to use parenthesis for visual organization:
    float(price) + (float(price) * 0.09)
  While the multiplication will execute first either way, it just makes it easier to read.
