	Be consistent with your whitespaces.
	Some of your indents use 4 spaces while others use tab. The correct way to indent in python is 4 spaces.
	If you use 4 whitespaces to indent, you must use exactly 4 whitespaces to unindent.
	I recommend setting your notepad editor to show you the whitespaces so that you can verify they are right. 

	sphereVolume()
		there is an issue with your function.
		if the radius is a 5, the volume should approximate to 523.6
			Your's returns 392.699
			You used (4/3)*(math.pi)*float(radius)**3
			It should be (4*(math.pi)*float(radius)**3)/3

	cToF()
		This function causes an infinite loop
		In your except statement, you could add...
			if celcius == 'exit':
				loop = False
		and then change "What is the temperature in Celsius?" to "What is the temperature in Celsius? (type 'exit' to quit program): 
	
	fToC()
		In this function, the loop is pointless. You set the loop variable, start the loop, and no matte what, set the loop variable to false.
		This function will never loop. The fix for this is the same as cToF()
